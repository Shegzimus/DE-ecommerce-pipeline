### Concepts

 [Airflow Concepts and Architecture](docs/1_concepts.md)

 #### Execution
 
  1. Build the image (only first-time, or when there's any change in the `Dockerfile`, takes ~15 mins for the first-time):
     ```shell
     docker-compose build
     ```
   
     or (for legacy versions)
   
     ```shell
     docker build .
     ```

 2. Initialize the Airflow scheduler, DB, and other config
    ```shell
    docker-compose up airflow-init
    ```

 3. Kick up the all the services from the container:
    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```

 4. In another terminal, run `docker-compose ps` to see which containers are up & running (should be matching with the services in your docker-compose file).

 5. Login to Airflow web UI on `localhost:8080` with default creds: `airflow/airflow`

 6. Login to PGAdmin web UI on `localhost:8081` with default creds: `admin@admin.com/admin`

 7. Run your DAGs on the Web Console.

 8. Check Great Expectations Docs `localhost:8082`

 9. On finishing your run or to shut down the container/s:
    ```shell
    docker-compose down
    ```

    To stop and delete containers, delete volumes with database data, and download images, run:
    ```
    docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
    ```

    or
    ```
    docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
    ```
